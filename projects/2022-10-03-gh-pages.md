# Creating a static website using GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) allows you to create and host a website using a GitHub repository and can be used alongside [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to give a site design and layout whislt only needing to create simple markdown or HTML files for the site content.

For my site I used the [Minimalist](https://www.bodunhu.com/minimalist/) Jekyll theme, updated some of the HTML (such as for the page footer) and added some basic information to the config file; such as the page title and description.

Now all I need to do is add markdown files to my GitHub repo to add pages about projects I have done, blog posts and more!
